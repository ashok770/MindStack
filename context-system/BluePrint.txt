🛠️ Phase 1: The Environment Check

Before starting, always check if your "engine" (Node.js) is ready.

    Check Version: node -v

    The Decision: * If Node is v20+, use npm create vite@latest.

        If Node is v18 or older, use npm create vite@5 (to avoid the crypto.hash error).

🏗️ Phase 2: Scaffolding (The Skeleton)

This is where you create the project folder and install the base tools.

    Create: npm create vite@<version> <project-name> -- --template react

    Enter Folder: cd <project-name>

    Install Base Files: npm install (This creates the node_modules folder).

🧠 Phase 3: Adding the "Special Abilities"

For this project, we needed Database and AI. You install these specific libraries using npm install.

    firebase: For the database and auth.

    @google/generative-ai: For the Gemini API.

📂 Phase 4: Organizing the Brain (Architecture)

Instead of putting all code in one file (which makes it crash-prone), we organized the src folder:

    src/api/: The "Outgoing" gate. This is where the logic to talk to Google and Firebase lives.

    src/components/: The "Visual" parts. Small, reusable UI pieces (buttons, inputs).

    .env: The "Vault". This stores secret API keys so they aren't exposed on GitHub.

🚀 Phase 5: The "Heartbeat" (Running it)

    Start Dev Server: npm run dev

    Access: Open http://localhost:5173.

        Why 5173? It's the default port for Vite (CRA used 3000).
