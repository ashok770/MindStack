🧭 PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PHASES (CLEAR & LOCKED)
🔹 PHASE 0 — Foundation (✅ DONE)

Goal: Make the system technically ready

✔ React project setup
✔ Firebase project created
✔ Firebase connected with React
✔ Authentication enabled
✔ Firestore enabled
✔ users & tasks collections created

👉 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
👉 Interview line:

“We first established a stable frontend–backend connection using Firebase.”

🔹 PHASE 1 — Authentication Flow (NEXT)

Goal: Identify who the student is

What we will build

Email & Password Sign Up

Login

Logout

Store user info in users collection

Firebase services used

Firebase Authentication

Firestore (users)

Why this phase is important

Every task must belong to a student

Required for personalization

👉 End result:
A logged-in student with a unique uid

🔹 PHASE 2 — Task Creation & Context Saving (CORE FEATURE)

Goal: Save what the student was doing

What we will build

Create a task (title)

Add context notes (thinking, reasoning, next steps)

Save task in Firestore

Firestore usage

Collection: tasks

Fields:

userId

title

contextNotes

lastUpdated

Why this is CRITICAL

🔥 This is your main innovation

👉 End result:
Student can pause work, and context is safely stored.

🔹 PHASE 3 — Resume with AI (UNIQUENESS)

Goal: Restore mental context using AI

What we will build

“Resume Task” button

Fetch last saved context

Send context to Gemini

Get a short AI-generated summary

Google tech used

Gemini API

Firebase (data source)

Example output

“You last worked on normalization and planned to write SQL queries next.”

👉 End result:
Instant resumption without cognitive load.

🔹 PHASE 4 — Dashboard & UX (POLISH)

Goal: Make it usable & demo-ready

What we will build

Student dashboard

List of tasks

Last updated time

Resume button

Why this matters

Judges care about usability

Makes demo smooth

🔹 PHASE 5 — Finalization (HACKATHON READY)

Goal: Submission & presentation

Tasks

Clean code

GitHub README

PPT completion

Demo video script

Focus

Clear story

Strong problem–solution link

Google tech usage clarity

🧠 ONE-SLIDE SUMMARY (PPT READY)

You can say:

“We divided development into phases: foundation, authentication, task context capture, AI-based resume, and final UX. This ensured clarity, speed, and successful delivery within hackathon time.”

🔥 Judges LOVE this.



----------------Questions----------------------
Q1: Why did you use AI here?

Answer:

“Because resuming work requires restoring mental context, which rule-based systems cannot handle effectively.”

Q2: Why Gemini?

Answer:

“Gemini integrates well with Google ecosystem and is effective at understanding academic context and summarization.”

🎤 INTERVIEW / JUDGE ANSWER (POWERFUL)

If asked:

“Why did you use Cloud Functions?”

You say:

“Gemini API does not reliably support direct browser calls, 
so we used Firebase Cloud Functions to securely handle AI requests and avoid CORS and key exposure.”
